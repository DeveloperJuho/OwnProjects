Done:

- Linear calculation for finding shards.
    - Parameter for different percentages.
- Create a webpage for linear calculation
- Create a local script file for Web UI 
    - Show all necessary data
- Progressive calculation for finding shards (Not finding a shard raises the chance)

To-Do:

Priority High:

- Add progressive calculation to the Web UI

Priority Medium:

- Create a server / API for calling functions using "Ajax"

Priority Low:

Bugs / Small updates:

- All calculations are still using the 32 shard model




Notes:

When turning the local script into webbased API, previous tables should probably be deleted locally when clicking the button on webpage. API should only send data with the chosen pick chance, not handle data deletion, because API's can be used using text based applications.
